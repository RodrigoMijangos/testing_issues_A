I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. 
Is this where it gets me? on my feet, several feet ahead of me.
I see it coming, do I run? or fire my gun? or let it be?
There's no beat, no melody.

Burr, my first friend, my enemy. Maybe the last face I ever see.
If I throw away my shot, is this how you'll remember me?
